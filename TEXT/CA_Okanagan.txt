7.      ARTICLE 7 â€“ ACADEMIC FREEDOM

Society benefits from the search for knowledge and its free exposition. Academic freedom is essential to both these purposes in the teaching function of the College as well as in its scholarship and research. There shall be no infringement or abridgement of the academic freedom of any faculty member. Faculty members are entitled, regardless of prescribed doctrine, to freedom in carrying out research and in publishing the results thereof, freedom of teaching and of discussion, freedom to criticize the College and freedom from institutional censorship. Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual. Rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching on an honest search for knowledge.
