11.1          Academic Freedom
11.1.1             The Board and Association recognize the need to protect academic freedom. Academic freedom is generally understood as the right to teach, engage in scholarly activity, and perform service without interference and without jeopardizing employment. This freedom is central to the Universityâ€™s mission and purpose and entails the right to participate in public life, to criticize University or other administrations, to champion unpopular positions, to engage in frank discussion of controversial matters, and to raise questions and challenges which may be viewed as counter to the beliefs of society.
11.1.2             Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching, scholarly activity and service in an honest and careful search for knowledge.
11.1.3             Members shall respect the academic freedom of others despite differences of opinion.
11.1.4             Academic freedom does not diminish the obligation of Members to fulfill their duties and responsibilities as defined within this Handbook.
11.1.5             The Board and the Association recognize their respective responsibilities to defend academic freedom as specified in this Article. These responsibilities may include, but are not limited to, providing legal support to Members in matters that arise from the exercise of academic freedom in accord with Article 11.01, educating Members on the rights and responsibilities related to academic freedom, and promoting academic freedom.
