6.      ARTICLE 6: ACADEMIC FREEDOM

6.01       The purpose of academic freedom is to provide security for fundamental academic values.

A university environment characterized by freedom of speech and of enquiry is required by the members to carry out the University's purpose. Freedom of speech guarantees the University as an open forum for the exchange of ideas; freedom of enquiry guarantees the University's commitment to the open investigation and interpretation of ideas.

Within the unique university context, the most crucial of human rights is the right to academic freedom. We affirm that this right is meaningless unless it entails the right to raise probing questions and challenges to the beliefs of society at large.

The parties agree to respect the right of all members of the academic community to exercise their academic freedom.

The commitments, rights, and responsibilities of members involve three major related roles: to participate in the search for basic truths, and to communicate openly the results of this search; to develop creative scholarship in specific disciplines, within which the students participate in the process of rational enquiry; to encourage where feasible the generalized application of scholarship and research to the benefit of the university community and the common good of society.

Members are entitled to freedom, without any form of institutional censorship, to disseminate their knowledge both inside and outside the classroom, to conduct research which they believe will enhance knowledge and to communicate the results of such research.

6.02       Members are entitled to exercise their political rights provided they respect their obligations to the Employer specified in the Collective Agreement.
