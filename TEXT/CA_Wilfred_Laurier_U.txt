7.      ARTICLE 7:               ACADEMIC FREEDOM
7.1              The common good of society depends upon the search for knowledge and its free expression. Academic freedom in universities is essential to both these purposes in the teaching function of the university as well as in its scholarship and research. Members shall not be hindered or impeded in any way by the University or the Association from exercising their legal rights nor shall they suffer any penalties because of the exercise of such legal rights. The Parties agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any Member. Members are entitled, regardless of prescribed doctrine, to freedom to practice their professions of teacher and scholar, or librarian, freedom in carrying out research and in publishing the results thereof, freedom of teaching and discussion, freedom of creative activity, freedom to select, acquire, disseminate, or use documents in the exercise of their professional responsibilities, freedom to criticize the University and the Association, and freedom from institutional censorship.
7.2              In exercising such freedom, Members have a responsibility to respect the academic freedom and rights of other members of the university community.
7.3              The censorship of information is inimical to the free pursuit of knowledge. The collection, organization, and dissemination of knowledge will be done freely and without bias in support of the research, teaching, and study needs of the university community. The Parties agree that no censorship based on moral, religious, or political values shall be exercised or allowed against any material which a Member desires to be placed in the library collections of the University.
7.4              Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual; rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible. Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity, nor does it diminish the obligations of Members to meet their duties and responsibilities. Members have a duty to exercise that freedom in a manner consistent with the academic obligations of teachers and scholars, and librarians.
