ARTICLE 11 
ACADEMIC FREEDOM
A.                 Faculty members and Professional Librarians have the right to academic freedom.
B.                 Academic freedom is the right to search for truth, knowledge and understanding and to express freely what one believes.
C.                 The University as an institution and the community of its scholars have a duty to protect and defend the search for knowledge and understanding by all who inquire, teach, offer professional library service and learn under their auspices. They shall be free to teach, to carry out scholarly research and creative activities and to publish the results thereof, and to discuss and to criticize both the University and the wider society it serves.
D.                 Furthermore, faculty members and Professional Librarians are entitled, regardless of prescribed doctrine, to freedom:
1.                  to practice their professions of teacher and scholar;
2.                  in their teaching and SRC duties and publishing the results thereof;
3.                  to select, acquire, disseminate, or use documents in the exercise of their professional responsibilities;
4.                  to discuss and to criticize the University, the Association, and society; and
5.                  from censorship by the University in these areas.
E.                  In exercising such freedom, there is a responsibility to adhere to the law and to respect the academic freedom of all others who enjoy academic freedom.
F.                  The censorship of information is inimical to the free pursuit of knowledge. The collection, organization, and dissemination of knowledge will be done freely and without bias in support of the teaching, SRC and study needs of the University community. The parties agree that no censorship based on moral, religious or political values shall be exercised or allowed against any material which an individual from either party desires to be placed in the library collections of the University.
G.                 Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual. Neither does it confer legal immunity nor diminish the obligation of individuals to meet their duties and responsibilities.
