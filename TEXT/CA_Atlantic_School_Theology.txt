10.  ARTICLE 10: ACADEMIC FREEDOM10.10      Academic Freedom Members10.10      Academic Freedom of Members(a)               The common good of society depends on the search for knowledge and its free exposition. Academic freedom in universities is essential to both these purposes in the teaching function of the University as well as in its scholarship and research.(b)               Members shall not be hindered or impeded in any way by the Employer or the Association from exercising their legal rights as citizens. Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity, nor does it diminish the responsibility of Members to meet their contractual obligations to the Employer. The parties to this Agreement agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any Member.(c)               Members are entitled to freedom in investigation, speculation, research activities, and in publishing and otherwise disseminating the results thereof; freedom in carrying out their professional responsibilities; freedom of teaching and of discussion; freedom to criticize the University, the Employer, the Administration, the Association, affiliated organizations and ecclesial bodies; and freedom from institutional censorship.(d)               Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching on an honest search for knowledge. In exercising their academic freedom, Members have a responsibility to respect the academic freedom and rights of other persons within the University community.(e)               Given the Employerâ€™s commitment to ensuring that the AST library provides to the University community the opportunity to access all expressions of knowledge, intellectual activity, information and ideas (subject to the University's financial and physical resources and its policies on confidentiality), it is the responsibility of Members who are Professional Librarians to promote such access, and to resist responsibly any efforts to limit such access.
