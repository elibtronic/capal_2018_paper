ARTICLE 14 – ACADEMIC FREEDOM
14.1          Generally,(a)    the unimpeded search for knowledge and its free expression and exposition are vital to a University and to the common good of society;(b)   Members have the right to academic freedom which shall include the freedom, individually or collectively, to develop and transmit knowledge and opinion through research, study, discussion, documentation, production, creation, teaching, lecturing and publication, regardless of prescribed or official doctrine, and without limitation or constriction by institutional censorship; and(c)    the Parties agree to uphold and to protect the principles of academic freedom, not to infringe upon or abridge academic freedom as set out in this Article, and to use all reasonable means in their power to protect that freedom when it is threatened.
14.2          Academic freedom includes the following interacting freedoms: freedom to teach, freedom to research, freedom to publish, freedom of expression, freedom to acquire materials. Academic freedom ensures that(a)    Members teaching courses have the right to the free expression of their views, and may choose course content, use teaching methods and refer to materials without censorship or reference or adherence to prescribed doctrine;(b)   Members have the freedom to carry out scholarly research without reference or adherence to prescribed doctrine;(c)    Members have the right to publish the results of their research without interference or censorship by the institution, its agents or others;(d)   Members have the right to freedom of expression, including the right to criticize the government of the day, the administration of the institution, or the Association; and(e)    Members have the freedom to exercise professional judgment in the acquisition of materials, and in ensuring that these materials are freely accessible to all for bona fide teaching and research purposes, no matter how controversial these materials may be.
14.3          Academic freedom does not require neutrality; rather, it carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research, teaching, publication and other forms of scholarly expression in an honest search for knowledge.
14.4          Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity; nor does it diminish the obligation of Members to meet their responsibilities to the University, including those set out in Article 15.
14.5          In the exercise of academic freedom, Members shall respect the academic freedom of others. In addition, Members are expected to recognize the rights of other members of the University community — faculty, staff and students.
14.6          In any exercise of freedom of expression, Members should not purport to speak on behalf of the University unless so authorized. An indication of affiliation with the University should not be construed as speaking on behalf of the University.
