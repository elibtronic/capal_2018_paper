ARTICLE 7:   ACADEMIC FREEDOM

7.01      The search for knowledge and its free exposition are fundamental characteristics of the continuing self-examination necessary to maintain a dynamic, free and vital society. In this context, Members shall not be hindered in the exercise of academic rights and shall be entitled to academic freedom. Academic freedom includes the right, without restriction by prescribed doctrine, to learn; freedom to teach and discuss; freedom to carry out research and disseminate and publish the results thereof; freedom to produce and perform creative works; freedom to engage in service to the institution and the community; freedom to express oneâ€™s opinion about the institution, its administration, or the system in which one works; freedom from censorship by either Party.

7.02      Academic freedom does not require neutrality. Rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible and may result in strong statements of beliefs and positions. The credibility and acceptability of the principle of academic freedom depends in part upon the freedom being used in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching on an honest search for knowledge. Academic freedom implies a respect for the rights of others, a tolerance of other points of view and a duty to use that freedom in a responsible manner.

7.03      The Parties agree to uphold and to protect the principles of academic freedom and not to infringe unlawfully or unreasonably upon nor to abridge the academic freedom of any Member. Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity, nor does it diminish in any way the obligation of Members to meet their responsibilities and to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with this Agreement as a whole. A Member who is found to be acting reasonably and lawfully and in accordance with this Article on academic freedom, shall not be subject to any disciplinary action as defined in Article 31 in response to that conduct.
