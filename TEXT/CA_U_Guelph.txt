7.      Article 7 - Academic Freedom

7.1              The Parties acknowledge that the common good of society depends upon the search for knowledge and its free exposition. Academic Freedom in universities is essential to both of these purposes in the scholarly pursuit of teaching and research.

7.2              The Parties agree to abide by the principles of Academic Freedom as expressed in this Article. Furthermore, the Parties recognize that universities are communities in which the right to criticize all aspects of society is valued and respected.

7.3              Academic Freedom is the right to examine, pursue, develop, and transmit knowledge and ideas through research, teaching, study, discussion, documentation, production, creation or writing. Academic Freedom specifically provides protection of:

a)      the pursuit of research, creative and scholarly activities, and publishing or making public the results thereof;

b)      the ability to teach and discuss;

c)      the creation or performance of works of art;

d)      freedom in service to the University, discipline, or community through the application of professional or academic skills; and

e)      freedom from institutional censorship; all without deference to prescribed doctrine.

7.4              Academic Freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual nor does it preclude commitment on the part of the individual. Rather, Academic Freedom makes such commitment possible.

7.5              Academic Freedom does not confer legal immunity in respect of opinions that may be expressed or activities that may be undertaken, nor does it diminish the obligations of members to meet their duties and responsibilities to the University.

7.6              The Parties agree to uphold and protect the principles of Academic Freedom as specified herein and take necessary steps to protect Members from harassment, threats, or abuse intended to limit or inhibit the exercise of Academic Freedom.

7.7              The exercise of Academic Freedom as per this Article shall not be grounds for disciplinary proceedings.
