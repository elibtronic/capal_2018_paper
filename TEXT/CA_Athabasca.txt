11.              Academic and Professional Freedom
11.1          General

Although these statements occur within the body of this Agreement, the various items herein are not subject to negotiation, abrogation, or diminution in any way. They may, however, be subject to later interpretation. Staff Members shall not be hindered or impeded in any way by the the Board or the Association from exercising their legal rights as citizens, nor shall they suffer any penalties because of the exercise of such legal rights.
11.2          Academic Freedom

The common good of society depends upon the search for knowledge and its free exposition. Academic freedom in universities is essential to both these purposes in the teaching function of the university as well as in its scholarship and research. The parties agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any member of the academic community. Members of the University community are entitled, regardless of prescribed doctrine, to freedom in carrying out research and in publishing the results thereof, freedom of teaching and of discussion, freedom to criticize Athabasca University and the Association, and freedom from institutional censorship. Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual. Rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to basic research and teaching, course development and delivery in a honest search for knowledge.
11.3          Professional Freedom

Each Professional Staff Member must be free to pursue excellence in the professional's field of competence, must be encouraged to contribute to the intellectual life of the University community, and must be encouraged to contribute to the intellectual life of the professional groups to which the Professional Staff Member belongs.
