Article 3: Academic Freedom and Access to Information

Academic Freedom

3.01      The University of Alberta is committed to the pursuit of truth, the advancement of learning, and the dissemination of knowledge.

3.02      The University expects each staff member to engage in these endeavours.

3.03      The parties to this Agreement subscribe to the principles of academic freedom, that is, the right to examine, to question, to teach, to learn, to investigate, to speculate, to comment, to criticize without deference to prescribed doctrine. Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity; nor does it diminish the obligation of members to meet their responsibilities to the University as set out in Article 7 (University responsibilities).

3.04      Members have the right to publish the results of their research without interference or censorship by the institution or its agents.
