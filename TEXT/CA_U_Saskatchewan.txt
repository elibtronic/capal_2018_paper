6.      ACADEMIC FREEDOM
6.1              The common good of society depends upon freedom in the search for knowledge and in its exposition. Academic freedom in teaching, scholarship and research at the University is essential to society. Accordingly, all employees, whether tenured or not and regardless of prescribed doctrine, are entitled to the exercise of their rights as citizens and to freedom in carrying out research and in publishing its results, freedom of discussion, freedom to teach the subject assigned in classes, freedom to criticize the University and the Association without suffering censorship or discipline. Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual, but makes commitment possible. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base teaching and research on an honest search for knowledge.
6.2              Employees shall not improperly represent themselves as speaking for the University.
