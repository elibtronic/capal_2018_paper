2.      ARTICLE 2:               ACADEMIC FREEDOM

2.1              The Employer and the Association agree to abide by the principles of academic freedom as expressed in the following statement: academic freedom involves the right to teach, investigate, speculate, and publish without deference to prescribed doctrine and free from institutional censorship. It involves the right to criticize the University and the Association. The right to academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a responsible way.

2.2              The Employer agrees that members have the right to privacy in their personal and professional communications and files, whether on paper or in electronic form. The level of privacy, however, does not exceed that of reasonable expectations.

2.3              Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity, nor does it diminish the obligation of members to meet their responsibilities as defined in this Agreement.
