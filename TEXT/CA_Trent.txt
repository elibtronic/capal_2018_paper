I.2.3           Academic Freedom
The common good of society depends upon the search for knowledge and its free exposition. Academic freedom in universities is essential to both these purposes in the teaching function of the university as well as in its scholarship and research. Academic staff shall not be hindered or impeded in any way by the University or the Association from exercising their legal rights as citizens, nor shall they suffer any penalties because of their exercise of such legal rights. The parties agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any member of the academic community. Members of the academic community are entitled, regardless of prescribed doctrine, to freedom in carrying out research and in publishing the results thereof, freedom of teaching and of discussion, freedom to select, acquire, disseminate, or use information, freedom to criticize the University and the Association, and freedom from institutional censorship. Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual. Rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching on an honest search for knowledge. The claim of academic freedom shall not excuse members from meeting the duties and responsibilities set forth in VIII.1 (i) and VIII.2(i) of this Agreement, provided that the allocation of such duties and responsibilities in accordance with VIII.3 through VIII.7 shall not conflict with principles of academic freedom.

Part I. Discrimination & Harassment Policy

5. Academic Freedom
Academic freedom is a fundamental tenet of University life and is a condition of employment expressly extended to academic employee groups pursuant to the terms of their respective collective agreements. Academic freedom includes the right to question and challenge traditional norms, and the freedom to define research questions, to pursue answers to those questions by way of unrestricted but proper investigative techniques and to disseminate the knowledge gained to students, academic colleagues and society as a whole. Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual. Rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching on an honest search for knowledge. The exercise of academic freedom may challenge and/or offend the ideas, sensibilities and beliefs of others. However, academic freedom does not confer immunity from the terms of this Policy.

Appendix B: Policy on Research and Scholarly Misconduct

II.        Principles of Integrity in Research, and Scholarship
Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research, and scholarship, on an honest search for knowledge. Researchers shall strive to follow the best research practices honestly, accountably, openly and fairly in the search for and in the dissemination of knowledge. In addition, researchers shall follow the requirements of all applicable institutional policies and professional or disciplinary standards, and shall comply with applicable laws and regulations. The University therefore holds its researchers and scholars responsible for upholding the following principles:
1.         Recognizing the substantive contributions of all collaborators, students, funders and sponsors; using unpublished work of other researchers and scholars only with permission and with due acknowledgement; and using archival material in accordance with the rules of the archival source;
2.         Obtaining the permission of the author before using new information, concepts or data originally obtained through access to confidential manuscripts or applications for funds for research or training that may have been seen as a result of processes such as peer review.
3.         Using a high level of rigour in proposing and performing research; in recording, analyzing, and interpreting data; and in reporting and publishing data and findings.
4.         Ensuring that authorship of published work includes, with their consent, all those and only those who have materially or conceptually contributed to, and share responsibility for, the contents of the publication, in a manner consistent with their respective contributions and authorship policies of relevant publications.
5.         Keeping complete and accurate records of data, methodologies and findings, including graphs and images, in accordance with the applicable funding agreement, institutional policies, and/or laws, regulations, and professional or disciplinary standards in a manner that will allow verification or replication of the work by others. Retaining original data records for a given study (by the researcher who generated the data) for at least five years after the research is published or otherwise publicly presented (if the form of the data permits this, and if assurances have not been given that data would be destroyed to assure anonymity);
6.         Retaining the personal information of research subjects in accordance with the data retention requirements of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act;
7.         Fostering a shared understanding about the ownership of, and access to, primary data, software, and other products of research amongst all collaborators, especially between supervisors and graduate students, before research is undertaken;
8.         Appropriately managing any real, potential or perceived conflict of interest in accordance with Trent University's Conflict of Interest Policy;
9.         Presenting accurately and completely one's scholarly and professional credentials and accomplishments when submitting grant applications, and when engaged in other professional duties and responsibilities where the invitation to do so is based at least in part on one's scholarly and professional credentials and accomplishments (e.g. sitting on a selection committee, NSERC committee);
10.       Complying with federal or provincial statutes or regulations, and with University regulations for the protection of researchers, human subjects or the public or for the welfare of laboratory animals;
11.       Complying with other reasonable legal and contractual requirements that relate to the conduct of research.
