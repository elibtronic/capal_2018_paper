ARTICLE 11 â€“ ACADEMIC FREEDOM

11.01      a.       The Parties acknowledge that they are committed to the pursuit of truth, the advancement of learning, and the creation, interpretation, preservation and dissemination of knowledge. To this end, they agree to uphold and protect the principles of academic freedom as expressed in the following statement: academic freedom is the freedom to examine, question, teach, and learn, and it involves the right to investigate, speculate, and comment publicly without deference to prescribed doctrine. The Parties agree that they will not infringe upon or abridge the academic freedom of any member of the University community.

b.       The right to academic freedom does not permit members of the University Community to infringe upon the academic freedom of other members.

11.02                Academic freedom does not require neutrality in expression or attitude. Rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible and may result in strong statements of beliefs and positions. The credibility and acceptability of the principle of academic freedom depend upon that freedom being used in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching on an honest search for knowledge. Likewise, these freedoms do not confer legal immunity or legal defense by the University for positions that members may take which are not specifically sanctioned by the University.

11.03                The Parties have a responsibility for the development and maintenance of academic freedom and the intellectual freedom implied therein. The Parties agree that every person has the right to have access to all expressions of knowledge, creativity and intellectual activity, such rights being essential to the health and development of a free society. Specifically, it is the responsibility of the University to facilitate access, to the best of its ability, to all expressions of knowledge and intellectual activity, including those which some elements of society may consider unconventional, unpopular, or unacceptable, by acquiring the widest possible variety of materials and by making all library and information-access facilities and services available to members of the University community.

11.04                Members shall be free in the choice and pursuit of research/scholarly/creative activities and in publishing the results and conclusions thereof; free in the choice and pursuit of teaching methods and content; free to discuss and criticize, including criticism of the University and the Union; and they shall be free from censorship by the Parties.

Professional librarian members shall be free to state their professional views on matters relating to their discipline. They also have a responsibility not to practice or permit censorship in the selection or use of library materials and to strive to provide to members of the University community the fullest possible access to information sources regardless of how controversial those may be.

11.05                Members shall have a right to disclose publicly information about risks to research participants or the general public or threats to the public interest that become known in the course of their research.
