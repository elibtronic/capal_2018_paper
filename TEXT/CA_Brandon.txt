5.      ARTICLE 5: ACADEMIC FREEDOM
5.1               Academic freedom is essential to the pursuit and dissemination of truth and knowledge as well as to the fulfillment of the University's objectives.
5.2               Academic Freedom includes the freedom·         to examine, to question, to teach, and to learn;·         to disseminate opinions on questions relating to the member's teaching, professional, and research activities both inside and outside the classroom;·         to pursue, without interference or reprisal, a member's own research, creative or professional activities, and to publish the results thereof.
5.3               Academic freedom respects the rights of members by protecting them from institutional censorship or reprisal when they act as members of the society or members of the University.
5.4               Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the member. Rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching on an honest search for knowledge. Members shall attempt to make clear that, except when specifically authorized to do so, they are acting in their own name and not in the name of the Employer.
5.5               The Parties agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any member.
