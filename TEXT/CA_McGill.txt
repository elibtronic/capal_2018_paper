Regulations Concerning Complaints of Sexual HarassmentPreambleMcGill University is committed to providing an environment that is free of sexual harassment and that promotes personal dignity and fair treatment of all members of the University community. Sexual harassment is considered a serious offence that is harmful to the individual affected as well as to the University community and will not be tolerated on any University property or in any University context. The University seeks to prevent sexual harassment by providing resources and programmes for education about sexual harassment, as well as procedures, including disciplinary procedures, for the resolution of sexual harassment complaints. All members of the University community share responsibility for promoting and maintaining an environment free of sexual harassment, but a particular onus is placed upon those in positions of academic or administrative authority to be aware of what constitutes sexual harassment and of what procedures are in place to address sexual harassment complaints, and to cooperate in the promotion of education to prevent sexual harassment. These regulations are to be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with these goals as well as with the principle of academic freedom and the provisions of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights.The following are specifically excluded from the purview of these regulations: sexual assault and consensual sexual relationships acknowledged by both parties as such.
Section 1- 
Definition1.1              Sexual harassment means1)      any conduct of a sexual nature directed towards another person wherea)      sexual activity is made an explicit or implicit term or condition of an individual’s employment or status in a course, program, or activity; or,b)      sexual activity is used as a basis for an employment or educational decision affecting an individual;2)      any conduct of a sexual nature directed towards another person the effect of which is to impair that person’s work or educational performance where it is known or ought to be known that the conduct is unwelcome;3)      any conducta)      that is discriminatory or hostile to those persons because of their sex in a manner that the person knows or ought reasonably to know creates for those persons an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working, learning, extracurricular, or, in the residences, living environment, andb)      that exceeds the bounds of freedom of expression or academic freedom.
1.2              For the purposes of Section 1.1, conduct of a sexual nature means any conduct whose intent, in whole or in part, is to seek the sexual attention or favour of the person to whom it is directed or whose intent, in whole or in part, is to treat the other person as an object of sexual desire.
1.3              For the purposes of Section 1.1, academic freedom is understood to be a reciprocal freedom between parties in any academic relationship, and the exercise of one person’s rights may not infringe upon another’s. The right of academic freedom is conferred equally upon all members of the McGill community, including faculty, students, and administrative and support staff.

1.4              The definition in Section 1.1 shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights.1.5              For the purposes of Section 1.1(1) the fact that the individual affected by the sexual harassment appeared to comply with the behaviour complained of is not relevant to establishing that the offence of sexual harassment has been committed. Clear consent to the behaviour complained of is relevant.1.6              Sexual harassment by a member or members of the University community on property occupied by the University, in a residence, or otherwise in a University context, is a University offence.1.7               “A member of the University community” includes anyone holding office under the University Charter and Statutes and anyone appointed or employed by, or registered as a student at, McGill University.1.8              Sexual harassment occurs “in a University context” when it affects, or may reasonably be perceived by the complainant to affect, a work or academic relationship, whether curricular or extra-curricular, whether on campus or not.Section 2 - Appointment and Responsibility of Officers2.1              These regulations will be administered by the Sexual Harassment Office (“the Office”).2.2              The Principal shall appoint a coordinator of the Sexual Harassment Office and a minimum of three sexual harassment officers.

Chapter 6 
Regulations on Research Policy
Preamble
Research in the University is relevant for the general benefits of society, as well as for specific intellectual purposes. It should be used to increase knowledge in ways that do not harm society. Furthermore, all teaching in the University should have a base in the creative experience of scholarly and scientific inquiry.

The University recognizes that research flourishes only in a climate of academic freedom. Since the conditions for good research in our many disciplines are quite different, individual investigators are normally expected to assume direct responsibility for the intellectual and ethical quality of the work. 

A serious responsibility rests on the individual members of the community who are best equipped through special knowledge to remain aware of the consequences of their research activity; the researcher must balance the possibility of harmful application against potential benefits.The present regulations cover all research activity.A gift is a voluntary transfer of property without valuable consideration or benefit of any kind to the donor, or to anyone designated by the donor. While a donor cannot impose obligations upon the University, the gift may be restricted as to its use. It may lead to the issuance of an official donation receipt for income tax purposes, at the request of the donor.A research contract is an agreement between a sponsor and the University in which the University and researcher(s) agree to perform a specified research project and which generally confers upon the sponsor rights to the results of that project. Title to any intellectual property arising is negotiated. The University will normally be compensated for the assignment of licences or other options. A default on the part of the University or researcher to perform the obligations undertaken may give rise to a liability for contractual breach. A research contract is a business transaction, hence all direct and indirect costs of the University, including the salaries of researchers, may be charged to the sponsor. To the extent that the dean of the faculty considers the research activity to be beyond the scope of normal research duties, researchers may earn honoraria apart from regular salary, under the terms of the research contract. Such remuneration and research activity should conform to the University policies on consulting.A research grant given in aid of research through the University is financial support for a researcher, conducting research in a particular subject area, without formal detailed stipulation as to the direction of such research. The research conducted forms part of the staff member’s regular research duties and is not normally the object of any additional compensation to the researcher. Title to the results of the research activity, including intellectual property, licensing or other related options is not vested in the grantor. A research grant does not generate enforceable obligations except as to the management of the funds for grant purposes and where applicable, according to the grantor’s guidelines or policies. A research grant has no limitations on publication and no requirements as to deliverables other than reporting and financial stipulations. A research grant usually covers direct costs, while indirect costs should be recovered whenever possible.Regulations1                    The University does not allow its staff or students to be engaged in secret research on University premises or using University facilities.2                    Certain kinds of research data in the custody of governments and other agencies are restricted in order to protect the privacy of individuals or private corporations. If the restriction is not such as to prevent the eventual use of the research undertaken by students or staff members for theses or publications, these restrictions are permissible. Such restrictions, as they relate to the use of research undertaken by students or staff members for theses or publications, should not exceed the delays set out in Regulation 3.3                    The University shall not accept requests from outside bodies for delays in publication in excess of one year. The Vice-Principal (Research), however, shall have the right to agree to requests for delays up to two years in exceptional cases, for example, when patents are pending or intended. In the case of theses, the student shall agree in writing to such a delay before the request is considered.4                    All research contracts shall be negotiated by the University’s Research Contracts Office in association with the principal investigator.5                    Neither the name of the University nor that of any member of staff shall be used for publicity in connection with a research contract without the prior written approval of the Vice-Principal (Research).6                    Title to intellectual property arising out of a contract, the obligations and abilities of different parties to seek patents, and the payment of associated royalties, shall be defined by the terms of the contract signed by the University, following negotiation by the Office of Technology Transfer.7                    Existing University “Regulations Governing Conflicts of Interest in Proprietary Research” shall apply to research arising out of research contracts.8                    No one may use University premises, or publications under its control or jurisdiction, to recruit in any manner a member of the University community as a participant in medical testing or in clinical trials involving human subjects related to non-University research projects.9                    A research director or principal investigator shall not employ a relative, whether by blood, marriage, or union, in a position funded by his or her research grant, contract, or otherwise under his or her jurisdiction, without prior written approval of the Vice-Principal (Research) and the relevant dean.10                Applicants for contracts or grants whose source is a government military agency shall indicate on the check list/approval form of the Office of Technology Transfer or the Research Grants Office whether this research has direct harmful consequences. Where the University so requires, the applicants shall furnish a written statement setting out the possibilities of direct harmful application and potential benefits of their research.11                The primary responsibility for undertaking research conforming to these regulations rests upon the researcher. The Vice-Principal (Research) shall supervise the procedures to be followed by researchers in fulfilling their responsibilities under paragraph 10 respecting research contracts sponsored by government military agencies. The Vice-Principal (Research) shall report regularly on contracts whose source is a military agency to the Executive Committee of the Board of Governors. The Vice-Principal (Research) shall advise the Board of Governors on whether the proposed contract conforms to McGill’s guidelines on research. The Board of Governors has final authority to approve these contracts after which Senate shall be informed.12                The Vice-Principal (Research) shall report to Senate, two years from their date of implementation, with respect to the general workings of the procedures and provide a summary of the decisions made.Regulations on Research Policy Source: Senate February 26, 1986 Minute 59 Board of Governors March 17, 1986 Minute 6053 Amendments:     Board of Governors September 15, 1986 October 20, 1986 Minute 6108 Minute 6128 Senate February 10, 1988 Minute 84 Board of Governors February 15, 1988 Minute 6323 Senate November 21, 1990 Minute 43 Board of Governors January 21, 1991 Minute 7781 Senate March 23, 1994 Minute 126 Board of Governors April 25, 1994 Minute 8135 Senate January 30, 2002 Minute 6 Board of Governors April 15, 2002 Minute 9
