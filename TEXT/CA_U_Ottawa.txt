9.      ARTICLE 9 *Academic Freedom

(a)                The parties agree neither to infringe nor abridge the academic freedom of the Members. Academic freedom is the right of reasonable exercise of civil liberties and responsibilities in an academic setting. As such it protects each Member's freedom to disseminate her opinions both inside and outside the classroom, to practice her profession as teacher and scholar, Librarian, or Counsellor, to carry out such scholarly and teaching activities as she believes will contribute to and disseminate knowledge, and to express and disseminate the results of her scholarly activities in a reasonable manner, to select, acquire, disseminate and use documents in the exercise of her professional responsibilities, without interference from the Employer, its agents, or any outside bodies. All the above-mentioned activities are to be conducted with due and proper regard for the academic freedom of others and without contravening the provisions of this agreement. Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the Member, but rather makes commitment possible. However, academic freedom does not confer legal immunity, nor does it diminish the obligations of Members to meet their duties and responsibilities.

(b)               The parties agree that no censorship based on moral, religious, or political values shall be exercised or allowed against any material which a Member desires to be placed in the library collections of the University of Ottawa.
