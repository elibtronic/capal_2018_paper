8.      ARTICLE 8.0 ACADEMIC FREEDOM, RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
8.1              ACADEMIC FREEDOM – FACULTY MEMBERS

The common good of society depends on the search for knowledge and its free exposition. Academic freedom in universities is essential to both these purposes in the teaching function of the university as well as in its scholarship and research. Faculty shall not be hindered or impeded in any way by the University or the Faculty Union from exercising their legal rights as citizens. Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity, nor does it diminish the obligation of faculty to meet their contractual responsibilities to the university. The parties agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any Faculty Member. Faculty Members are entitled, regardless of prescribed doctrine, to freedom in carrying out research and in publishing the results thereof, freedom of teaching and of discussion, freedom to criticise the university and the faculty union, and freedom from institutional censorship. Academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research and teaching on an honest search for knowledge. In exercising their academic freedom, Faculty have a responsibility to respect the academic freedom and rights of other members of the University Community.

8.2              ACADEMIC FREEDOM – PROFESSIONAL LIBRARIANS

The University is committed to ensuring that its library provide to the University Community the opportunity to access all expressions of knowledge, intellectual activity, information and ideas, subject to the University's policies on confidentiality and its resources. It is the responsibility of Librarians to promote such access, and to responsibly resist any efforts to limit such access. Such responsibility implies the right to investigate, speculate and disseminate knowledge. This responsibility does not confer legal immunity, nor does it diminish the responsibility of Librarians to meet their contractual obligations to the University. Professional Librarians shall not be hindered or impeded in any way by the University or the Union from exercising their legal rights as citizens. Professional Librarians are entitled, regardless of prescribed doctrine, to freedom in carrying out their professional responsibilities, freedom of discussion, and freedom from institutional censorship. In exercising their academic freedom, Librarians have a responsibility to respect the academic freedom and rights of other members of the University Community.

8.3              ACCESS TO INFORMATION

The University is committed to ensuring that its Library and ITSS provide to the members of the university community covered by this Agreement the opportunity to access all expressions of knowledge, intellectual activity, information and ideas, subject to the University’s policies on confidentiality and its available resources. It is understood that this access does not include access to the University’s own administrative and financial databases. This right to access to information carries with it the duty to use such information in a responsible way, consistent with fair and ethical dealings with students and colleagues and consistent with the employee’s performance of their employment responsibilities.
