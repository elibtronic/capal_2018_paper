3.      Article 3: Academic Freedom

3.01          The Parties recognize and affirm that academic freedom is essential to the fulfillment of the purpose of Dalhousie University in the search for knowledge and the communication of knowledge to students, colleagues and society at large. The Parties agree that academic freedom carries with it a corresponding responsibility on the part of Members to use their freedom responsibly, with due concern for the rights of others, for the duties appropriate to the Member's university appointment, and for the welfare of society. Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity either inside or outside Dalhousie University, nor does it prevent collective self-governance and peer evaluation as conducted or approved by the Senate or by other academic, research or professional bodies whether within or outside Dalhousie University. Academic freedom does not require neutrality on the part of the individual. Rather, academic freedom makes commitment possible.

3.02          The Parties agree that they will not infringe or abridge the academic freedom of any member of the academic community. Members of the bargaining unit are entitled to freedom, as appropriate to the Member's university appointment, in carrying out research and in publishing the results thereof, freedom of teaching and of discussion, freedom to criticize, including criticism of the Board and the Association, and freedom from institutional censorship.

3.03          Academic freedom, as appropriate to the Member's university appointment, implies protection of Members by the Board and the Association from pressure intended to hinder or prevent them pursuing their scholarly and research interests and communicating the results thereof to students, colleagues and the community at large. The Parties acknowledge this responsibility, whether such pressure emanates from inside or outside the University.
