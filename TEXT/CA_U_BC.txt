PART 1: FRAMEWORK FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA and the FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA
DESIRING to promote fair and proper economic conditions and terms of appointment for Faculty Members, Librarians, and Program Directors at The University of British Columbia;
RECOGNIZING that the University is a community of scholars whose essential functions are the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge and understanding through research and teaching and that academic freedom is essential to carrying out these functions;
BEING DETERMINED not to interfere with that academic freedom;
CONFIRM THAT the members of the University enjoy certain rights and privileges essential to the fulfillment of its primary functions: instruction and the pursuit of knowledge. Central among these rights is the freedom, within the law, to pursue what seems to them as fruitful avenues of inquiry, to teach and to learn unhindered by external or non-academic constraints, to engage in full and unrestricted consideration of any opinion. This freedom extends not only to the regular members of the University but to all who are invited to participate in its forum. Suppression of this freedom, whether by institutions of the state, the officers of the University or the actions of private individuals, would prevent the University from carrying out its primary functions. All members of the University must recognize this fundamental principle and must share responsibility for supporting, safeguarding and preserving this central freedom. Behaviour which obstructs free and full discussion, not only of ideas which are safe and accepted but of those which may be unpopular or even abhorrent, vitally threatens the integrity of the University's forum. Such behaviour cannot be tolerated;AND HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:
