4.                  Academic Freedom
4.1              In a democratic society, academic freedom in teaching, scholarship, and research is a fundamental value that is essential to the common good. The search for knowledge and the free expression of it are inherent rights that both Parties will protect vigilantly. Academic freedom is the freedom to conduct research, examine, question, teach and learn, and it involves the right to investigate, speculate and comment, as well as the right to criticize and challenge the University, the Association and society at large.
4.2              The Parties agree that they will not infringe on or abridge the academic freedom of any Member. Members have the right, regardless of prescribed doctrine, to be free from the threat of institutional reprisals and arbitrary constraint, and without regard to outside influence, to pursue their academic interests and activities, to conduct research and publish the results thereof, to engage in teaching and discussion, to pursue creative activity, and to select, acquire, disseminate, or otherwise use all forms of documentary materials in the exercise of their professional responsibilities.
4.3              Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, Members will not be hindered in any way by the University or the Association in the exercise of their legal rights, including but not limited to the exercise of their freedom of thought, belief, opinion or expression, nor will they suffer any institutional reprisals because they choose to exercise such rights. A Member must not purport to represent or speak on behalf of the University except to the extent that the Member has been authorized by the University. This does not limit Members in expressing their own academic or professional opinions.
4.4              Access to information is fundamental to the free pursuit of knowledge. The Parties recognize and agree that subject to the laws of Canada and the Province of British Columbia:
4.4.1        The collection, organization, and dissemination of knowledge must proceed fairly without censorship based on moral, religious, commercial, political or other grounds;
4.4.2        Members have the right to collect, organize, disseminate and use any information, knowledge and creative works without censorship; and
4.4.3        The development of the University Libraries' collections will proceed without censorship.
4.5              In exercising academic freedom, Members must act in a responsible manner and respect the academic freedom and rights of other members of the University community.
