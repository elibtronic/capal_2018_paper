Article 14 ACADEMIC FREEDOM
14.01            The unimpeded search for knowledge and its free exposition are vital to a university and to the common good of society. To this end, the Parties agree to strive to uphold and to protect the principles of academic freedom and not to infringe upon or abridge academic freedom as set out in this article.
14.02            Employees shall have:(a)   freedom of discussion, freedom to criticize, including criticism of the University of New Brunswick and the Association, freedom from censorship by the Parties, and freedom to consider and study all available expressions of creativity, knowledge, and intellectual activity, including those which may be considered by some elements of society to be unconventional, unpopular or unacceptable;(b)   freedom in the choice and pursuit of research, and freedom to disseminate or to withhold dissemination of the results and conclusions of such research;(c)   freedom in the choice and pursuit of teaching methods, and to state their views on matters relating to their discipline.This Article 14.02 is subject to Articles 22A.15, 22B.15, 22C.15 and 22E.14.
14.03            Academic freedom does not require neutrality; rather, academic freedom carries with it the duty to use that freedom in a manner consistent with the scholarly obligation to base research, teaching and scholarship on an honest search for knowledge.
14.04            Academic freedom does not confer legal immunity, nor does it diminish the obligation of Employees to meet their responsibilities to the University of New Brunswick. Employees shall not be hindered or impeded in any way, by either of the Parties, from exercising their legal rights, nor shall they suffer any penalties because of the exercise of such legal rights.
